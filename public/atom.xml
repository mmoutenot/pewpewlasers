    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My degree, like most, comes with a litany of prescribed courses. I left all of
my required humanity, art and social science courses (unaffectionately called
HASS credits) for my senior year because, heck, I thought that sounded fun. I
would get all of my hard maths and computer science classes done, allowing me to
split my energy in the final year. I could spend half of my energy going to
school and the other half applying the knowledge I had hopefully gained from the
previous three years to side projects and part-time work.</p>

<p>So, in my second-to-last semester, one of the classes I chose was Introduction
To Economics. Why not? I was confident in my ability to solve single variable
equations, and I enjoyed a basic economics course I took in highschool. I
actually started to look forward to it.</p>

<p>Jump to the first day. I’m sitting down in class surrounded by a thousand
freshmen either playing Gangam-style Tetris or furiously scribbling the
lecturer’s words as if they were scripture. We started with the usual
formalities. Office hours, recitation (“Definitely go! These will be helpful!”).</p>

<p>My mind wandered to one of my side projects, <a href="http://app.snppi.com">Snappi</a>. I
was dying to reimplement the way in which I connected to different APIs. When I
zoned back in, the professor was talking about “Opportunity Cost”.</p>

<blockquote><p>op.por.tu.ni.ty cost</p>

<p>the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when on alternative is chosen</p></blockquote>

<p>I immediately stood up and marched towards the door. I never attended lecture or
recitation again.</p>
