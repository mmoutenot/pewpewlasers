    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past weekend was <a href="http://www.tuftshackathon.com">Tuftâ€™s second annual Hackathon</a>, a 24-hour event where students and mentors code and design projects. The event was the product of months of planning, and the last week was a sprint of emails, catering orders, and most importantly t-shirts.</p>

<p>We decided to order our t-shirts from the same company we did last year, <a href="http://bluecotton.com">Blue Cotton</a>. Everything was going swimmingly until after a failed delivery attempt, UPS decided to reroute the shirts to Nashville, TN. As we watched our package move farther and farther away, UPS was of little help.</p>

<p>The day before the event, with no time to spare, we reached out to our customer representative at Blue Cotton, Danyel. She had been aware of our desperate situation and decided to help us out. After a 2PM phone call the day before the event, Blue Cotton reprinted all of our shirts and overnight shipped them from Kentucky to Boston. By 9:30AM the next day - the day of the event - they were at our front door and everyone looked fantastic.</p>
