My degree, like most, comes with a litany of prescribed courses. I left all of
my required humanity, art and social science courses (unaffectionately called
HASS credits) for my senior year because, heck, I thought that sounded fun. I
would get all of my hard maths and computer science classes done, allowing me to
split my energy in the final year. I could spend half of my energy going to
school and the other half applying the knowledge I had hopefully gained from the
previous three years to side projects and part-time work.

So, in my second-to-last semester, one of the classes I chose was Introduction
To Economics. Why not? I was confident in my ability to solve single variable
equations, and I enjoyed a basic economics course I took in highschool. I
actually started to look forward to it.

Jump to the first day. I’m sitting down in class surrounded by a thousand
freshmen either playing Gangam-style Tetris or furiously scribbling the
lecturer’s words as if they were scripture. We started with the usual
formalities. Office hours, recitation (“Definitely go! These will be helpful!”).

My mind wandered to one of my side projects, [Snappi](http://app.snppi.com). I
was dying to reimplement the way in which I connected to different APIs. When I
zoned back in, the professor was talking about “Opportunity Cost”.

>op.por.tu.ni.ty cost

>the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when on alternative is chosen

I immediately stood up and marched towards the door. I never attended lecture or
recitation again.
