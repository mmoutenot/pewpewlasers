Howdy. I am a senior studying computer science and engineering at Tufts
University. In the past I have worked for Mozilla, Microsoft and Emma Inc
specializing in security.

Recently, I have emerged from the dark, secretive depths of security to create
user-facing products. This switch prompted a number of side projects, most
notably [Snappi](http://app.snppi.com) which is regularly featured on the
[Evernote Trunk](http://trunk.evernote.com) and mentioned in the
Italian version of Wired magazine (what?). I also  work at [Redstar
Ventures](http://www.redstar.com/) where I lead mobile development of
[Loopit](http://loopit.com).

I have also become very interested in education reform. My friend
[Alden](http://twitter.com/aldenks) and I are starting a program that helps kids
find their passion for computers and an engineering mindset. Through this, we
hope to narrow the gender divide in the technology industry and help
underprivlidged kids gain skills that are not feasible to teach at their schools.

Oh, and I am obsessed with motorcycles. I currently have a '72 Yamaha DT100k and
a '12 TU250X. A cross country trip for this upcomming summer is in the works!
